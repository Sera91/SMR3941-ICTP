# Intro to Large Language Models (LLMs)


## Outline

The goal of these lectures is to delve into Large Language Models, starting with an introduction to Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, exploring the Transformer architecture and the GPT-2 generative model in PyTorch. Finally, we will play with opensource pre-trained LLMs such as Llama and Mistral.

* Lecture 1: The Transformer Architecture;
* Lecture 2: Coding GPT-2 step by step;
* Lecture 3: Open Source LLM: Mistral Embeddings;
* Lecture 4: Open Source LLM: basics of RAG with Mistral.
